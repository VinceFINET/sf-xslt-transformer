# Salesforce XSLT Transformer

I once had the idea to transform the metadata xml files (retrieved with our dear old friend ANT)
into a more comprehensive html file/report.

It surely needs some rework to make it work with SFDX etc. but here you can see the XSLT file.

Don't hesitate to participate on this one and give me feedback.
